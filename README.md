## Introduction

This project aims to build a robust model for predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Dataset from IBM. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling them to take proactive measures to retain these customers. The focus of this project is not only on achieving accurate predictions but also on ensuring that these predictions are interpretable and actionable.

To achieve this, the project integrates the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) algorithm, a powerful tool for model explainability. SHAP provides both global and local explanations, helping data scientists and business stakeholders understand which factors contribute most to customer churn. This dual focus on prediction accuracy and explainability is essential in making the modelâ€™s insights both trustworthy and actionable for business decisions.

The analysis provides valuable insights into the risk factors for customer churn, guiding companies on where to focus their retention efforts. This combination of predictive modeling and explainability offers a comprehensive tool for businesses looking to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.


## Datasets

These datasets were taken from [here](https://accelerator.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=authoring&pathRef=.public_folders/IBM+Accelerator+Catalog/Content/DAT00148&id=i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204&objRef=i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204&action=run&format=HTML&cmPropStr=%7B%22id%22:%22i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204%22,%22type%22:%22reportView%22,%22defaultName%22:%22DAT00148%22,%22permissions%22:%5B%22execute%22,%22read%22,%22traverse%22%5D%7D)

These are Telecommunications Industry Sample Data given by IBM. The Telco customer churn data contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.

I analyzed these datasets about:
* Demographics information
* Location information
* Population information
* Services information
* Status information
* a complete [dataset](Data/CustomerChurn.xlsx) about Customer Churn. This is the dataset I used to make prediction and explanations
