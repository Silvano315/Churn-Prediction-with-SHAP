## Introduction

This projects aims to classify potential churn customers using a Telco Customer Dataset from IBM. The main applications are about the explainability integration with SHAP algorithm and the creation of an interactive dashboard with Exploratory, Classification and Explainability insights.

## Datasets

These datasets were taken from [here](https://accelerator.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=authoring&pathRef=.public_folders/IBM+Accelerator+Catalog/Content/DAT00148&id=i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204&objRef=i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204&action=run&format=HTML&cmPropStr=%7B%22id%22:%22i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204%22,%22type%22:%22reportView%22,%22defaultName%22:%22DAT00148%22,%22permissions%22:%5B%22execute%22,%22read%22,%22traverse%22%5D%7D)

These are Telecommunications Industry Sample Data given by IBM. The Telco customer churn data contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.
